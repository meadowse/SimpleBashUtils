While many can pursue their dreams in solitude, other dreams	are	like great storms blowing hundreds, even thousands dreams apart in their wake.


Dreams breathe life into men and can cage them in suffering.

Men live and die by their dreams. But lon g after they have been abandonned they still smolder deep in men's hearts. Some see nothing more than life and death. The are dead, fo r they have no dreams.
It is my preception, that a tru e, friend never relies on another's dream. A person with the potential to be my tru friend	, must be able to find his reason f or life without help
